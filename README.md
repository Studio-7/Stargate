# Stargate
### A peer to peer game streaming server  
Stargate is a game capture and streaming server. It is uses WebRTC to stream the capture as MJPEG. Has to be used with the signaling server, Discovery, for making the server visible to the frontend, i.e. Pulsar.  

This project is still a work in progress. There is no support for audio or game detection and the in-game controls are jittery.
