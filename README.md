# Stargate
### A peer to peer game streaming server  
Stargate is a game capture and streaming server. It uses WebRTC to stream the capture using VP8 encoding. Has to be used with the signaling server, [Discovery](https://github.com/cvhariharan/Discovery), for making the server visible to the frontend, i.e. [Pulsar](https://github.com/cvhariharan/Pulsar).  

This project is still a work in progress. There is no support for audio or game detection and the in-game controls are jittery.
